## What is Etch-a-Sketch
The Etch-a-Sketch project enables users to draw and create their own sketches. 
Users can select either random or black as the color, and then by clicking the mouse, they can enable drawing on the board. 
This allows users to hover over the board and draw whatever they intend to create. Additionally, clicking the mouse again will disable drawing, providing a way to toggle between drawing and navigation mode.

## What i learned
During the development of the Etch-a-Sketch project, I gained valuable knowledge and skills in the following areas:
- DOM manipulation: 
  I learned how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the user interface and create interactive features.
- Mouseover and click events: 
  implementing mouseover and click events allowed me to respond to user actions effectively, enabling drawing functionality based on user interactions.
- Functions:
  Utilizing functions helped in organizing the code and making it modular, improving readability and maintainability.
- Html, Css and Javascript:
  Working on this project allowed me to enhance my proficiency in these web technologies, enabling me to create engaging and responsive applications.

By providing the ability to toggle drawing on and off through a simple click, users have greater control over their artistic creations and can easily switch between drawing mode and navigation mode. This feature enhances the user experience and adds an extra level of interactivity to the Etch-a-Sketch project. Overall, the Etch-a-Sketch project provided me with hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of web development concepts, making me more confident in building interactive and creative applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
